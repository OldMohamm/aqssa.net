  Motorola Solutions MOTOTRBO R7 is a revolutionary two-way digital radio built to enable mission-critical communications in any, and every business setting. Unlike other two-way radios, the Mototrbo R7 is specifically built with an IP68 rugged design. This means the device is completely protected from internal dust damage and is fully watertight when submerged in liquid, making the radio the perfect choice to ensure clear communications within potentially dangerous industry environments like construction, oil and gas, and more.

Given the necessity of communication clarity for everyday business operations, the MOTOTRBO R7 also has the advantage of game-changing audio capabilities in a rugged future-ready device. This includes next-level noise canceling, loudness, and clarity in high-density and noise environments where audio communications can be challenging. In addition, each radio presents a large 2.4-inch color display that simplifies the communication process during mission-critical applications. Commonly used information like text messages, notifications, and job tickets can be viewed with a single button press.
